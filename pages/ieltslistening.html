         	    <h3 class="mt-0">Introduction to IELTS Listening </h3>
         	         <p>From 4 January 2020, some small changes were introduced to the instructions and layout of the paper-based Listening test:The word ‘Sections’ was changed to ‘Parts’ – The paper-based test will now be divided into Part 1, 2, 3, 4.The Part 1 example was removed.We have also removed the page number references.There are four parts with ten questions each. The questions are designed so that the answers appear in the order they are heard in the audio.The first two parts deal with situations set in everyday social contexts. In Part 1, there is a conversation between two speakers (for example, a conversation about travel arrangements), and in Part 2, there is a monologue in (for example, a speech about local facilities). The final two parts deal with situations set in educational and training contexts. In Part 3, there is a conversation between two main speakers (for example, two university students in discussion, perhaps guided by a tutor), and in Part 4, there is a monologue on an academic subject.The recordings are heard only once. They include a range of accents, including British, Australian, New Zealand, American and Canadian.

 					<h3 class="mt-0">IELTS Preparation Tips - Listening Section</h3>
                    <p>
                 The Listening section is the first and most important part of the IELTS test. This section of IELTS has four sections and includes 40 items. In terms of IELTS preparation, it is best to take each section separately. Here are the IELTS preparation tips for Listening section.
                   </p>
                   <p> <li> One-on-one interaction:</li> </p>
                   <p> As the name suggests, the one-on-one section is an interaction between two people. It could be a telephonic conversation or a general one and candidates will be asked to note down specific information from the conversation. The best way to prepare for this IELTS section is by listening to as many as conversations possible. A very easy method is to practice listening to English bulletins regularly. One of the difficulties that a non-native English listener faces is to comprehend the fluency of native English speakers. However, this obstacle can be easily overcome with a regular practice involving listening and noting it down on paper.</p>
                    <p> <li>Speech:</li> </p>
                    <p>	 In this section, the test-takers are made to listen to a speech. They would listen to a speech in a social or academic context and answer a series of questions asked. The test will measure how well one can grasp the core idea of the speech and understand highlighted issues.</p>
                     <p> <li>Monologue: </li> </p>
                     <p>Similar to speech, this section involves a monologue. The best IELTS preparation tips to prepare for this is by mainly listening to discussions on television.</p>
                     <p> <li>Group discussion: </li> </p>
                   <p> This involves interaction between a maximum of four people. So, it is important that candidates ensure to make their own selves feel comfortable catching up with more than one speech flow. Again, attending and listening to discussions are the best ways to prepare for this sectional test. </p>

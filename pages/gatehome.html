         	         <p>
         	         	The Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is an examination that primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of various undergraduate subjects in engineering and science. The GATE score of a candidate reflects the relative performance level of a candidate. The score is used for admissions to various post-graduate education programs (e.g. Master of Engineering, Master of Technology, Master of Architecture, Doctor of Philosophy) in Indian higher education institutes, with financial assistance provided by MHRD and other government agencies. Recently, GATE scores are also being used by several Indian public sector undertakings for recruiting graduate engineers in entry-level positions. It is one of the most competitive examinations in India. GATE is also recognized by various institutes outside India, such as Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

         	         <p>
         	         	GATE is conducted jointly by the Indian Institute of Science and seven Indian Institutes of Technologies at Roorkee, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Chennai (Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay) on behalf of the National Coordination Board – GATE, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Government of India.

         	         <p>
         	         	What’s the takeaway? A high score on the GATE will play a critical and crucial role in your application for post-graduate education programs in Indian higher education institutes.

         	    <h3>What is tested on GATE?</h3>
         	          <p> This Exam basically tests your knowledge about your engineering discipline. It is to test students knowledge and understanding of their under Graduate level subjects in Engineering and Science.
         	          </p>
         	          <p>
         	          The examination is of 3 hours duration, and contains a total of 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onwards, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both Multiple Choice Questions or MCQs (four answer options out of which the correct one has to be chosen) and Numerical Answer Type questions or NATs (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.

         	    <h3> What is a good GATE score? </h3>
         	    	<p>
         	    		Any score that may get to your desired goal is good enough. Once you reach there, no one is going to ask whether you scored 900 or 600. If you want to secure a job in a PSU, that too a Maharatna, you should think about securing at least 800+. You should do some exploration on the Institutions to which you need to send your scores and set yourself practical objectives in light of the normal scores acknowledged by those projects. A good GATE score should also be the one that gets the candidates shortlisted for the PSU recruitments. <br><br>Candidates who fall under the range of 600 – 800 also have a chance for admissions into IITs. In addition to the scores, a written test and interview is also conducted for the shortlisted candidates by some IITs for admissions. <br><br> GATE Percentile
				Percentile is the percentage of people behind you in the GATE exam. Percentile is calculated as shown below:

			<img src="gate.jpeg" alt="Simply Easy Learning" width="800" height="100">
			<br><br> Based on the different factors of the exam conducted, the percentile for the GATE exam is calculated. Based on the percentile for the exam, the students can get admission into various colleges/institutes. <br><br> The different institutes release their cutoff marks or percentile for the admission which the student must acquire to get admission in the respective college. The percentile for GATE 2020 exam is conducted after the exam is conducted and it depends on the various factors including: <br>1. The total number of candidates who have appeared for the GATE exam. <br> 2. The difficulty level of the paper. <br> 3. Category for which the candidate is applying. <br> 4. The total number of seat availability.
			
       	 	   	<h3>How to send the scores to your Preferred Institutions?</h3>
       	 	   		<p>
       	 	   			GATE is one of the most competitive exams for engineering graduates. However, one can also get admission in some foreign universities through GATE. To apply for post-graduate education programs in Indian higher education institutes, you can fill out the application forms that are put out by the respective Institutes and check their cut-off requirements. However, one can also get admission in some foreign universities through GATE. Apart from educational institutions in India, the GATE scores are accepted by four foreign universities for admission of candidates to postgraduate courses as the examination has international recognition too. The four foreign universities that consider GATE scores include National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore and Technical University of Munich and RWTH Aachen in Germany. You can view your GATE scores by loging in to <a href="https://appsgate.iitd.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this GATE website</a>.
       	 	   		</p>
       	 	    <h3>Where is the GATE offered?</h3>
       	 	    	<p>
       	 	    		The computer-delivered GATE is administered by the Indian Institute of Science on select test dates at testing centers. IIT Bombay will release the list of exam centres of GATE 2021 where the entrance examination will be held. According to last year's data, there will be a total of eight zonal GATE 2021 exam centres. Moreover, last year GATE exam centres 2021 were reduced to 199 as authorities had reduced some cities and added a few.

       	 	    <h3> When to take the GATE? </h3>
       	 	    	<p>
       	 	    		There is no best time to start the GATE preparation. Its upto you when you start but i think you can start from your engineering 2nd year itself, as mostly technical subjects start from 2nd year. So together with your semester you can keep ready all the topics as per GATE syllabus . The points you need to consider:<br> 1. You should make proper notes for each topic or subject so later it will be easy for you to revise. <br> 2. Revise the notes after semester exam finish. <br> 3. So keep revising the notes in every 3 months. <br> 4. Practice more questions to get conceptual knowledge
       	 	    	</p>
       	 	    	
       	 	    <h3>How much does it cost to take the GATE? </h3>
       	 	        <p>
       	 	        	The General category candidates will have to pay Rs 1,500 to fill GATE 2020 application form. Candidates, who are from reserved category, needs to pay Rs 750. For Foreign students, their cost would be $200.

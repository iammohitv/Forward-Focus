Many studies published in languages other than English have been overlooked by global reviews. This is just one part of the issue. The dominance of English as the lingua franca of science also makes non-English speaking researchers miss out on research published in English. The author cites two problems: one is the English speaking community failing to notice non-English research papers and two is non-English researchers missing on researches published in English. Which of the following examples can be used to substantiate the second problem?", "A. Japanese researcher is not able to get his paper, written in Japanese, published in a popular English journal", "B. A German scientist feels the media is to be blamed since it fails to report non-English researches", "C. Science journalism is not fully developed in languages other than English","D. Conservation scientists in Spain feel their access to important information on conservation is limited due to language issues","E. A Scottish geologist feels if the methodology is good, language should not be an issue", "D" ],

                   <h3 class="mt-0">Part 1 – Introduction and interview</h3>
                   <p><li>
                  In this part, the examiner introduces him/herself and checks the test takers' identity. They then ask the test takers general questions on some familiar topics such as home, family, work, studies and interests. To ensure consistency, questions are taken from a script.Part 1 lasts for 4–5 minutes.This part of the test focuses on the ability to communicate opinions and information on everyday topics and common experiences or situations by answering a range of questions.
                   </li></p>
                   <h3 class="mt-0">Part 2 – Long turn</h3>
                   <p><li>
                  Part 2 is the individual long turn. The examiner gives the test takers a task card which asks the test takers to talk about a particular topic, includes points to cover in their talk and instructs the test takers to explain one aspect of the topic. Test takers are given one minute to prepare their talk, and are given a pencil and paper to make notes. The examiner asks the test takers to talk for 1 to 2 minutes, stops the test takers after 2 minutes, and asks one or two questions on the same topic.Using the points on the task card effectively, and making notes during the preparation time, will help the test takers think of appropriate things to say, structure their talk, and keep talking for 2 minutes.Part 2 lasts 3–4 minutes, including the preparation time.This part of the test focuses on the ability to speak at length on a given topic (without further prompts from the examiner), using appropriate language and organising ideas coherently. It is likely that the test takers will need to draw on their own experience to complete the long turn.

                   <h3 class="mt-0">IELTS Speaking - How it's marked</h3>
                    <p>
                 Task 1 responses are assessed on:
                 <li>Marking and assessment:Speaking performances are assessed by certificated IELTS examiners. All IELTS examiners hold relevant teaching qualifications and are recruited as examiners by the test centres and approved by the British Council or IDP: IELTS Australia.Scores are reported in whole and half bands. Detailed performance descriptors have been developed which describe spoken performance at the nine IELTS bands.</li>
                 <li>Fluency and coherence:This refers to the ability to talk with normal levels of continuity, rate and effort and to link ideas and language together to form coherent, connected speech. The key indicators of fluency are speech rate and speech continuity. The key indicators of coherence are logical sequencing of sentences, clear marking of stages in a discussion, narration or argument, and the use of cohesive devices (e.g. connectors, pronouns and conjunctions) within and between sentences.</li>
                 <li>Lexical resource:This criterion refers to the range of vocabulary used and the precision with which meanings and attitudes can be expressed. The key indicators are the variety of words used, the adequacy and appropriacy of the words used and the ability to circumlocute (get round a vocabulary gap by using other words) with or without noticeable hesitation.</li>
                 <li>Grammatical range and accuracy:This refers to the range and the accurate and appropriate use of the test takers' grammatical resource. The key indicators of grammatical range are the length and complexity of the spoken sentences, the appropriate use of subordinate clauses, and the range of sentence structures, especially to move elements around for information focus. The key indicators of grammatical accuracy are the number of grammatical errors in a given amount of speech and the communicative effect of error.</li>
                   <li> Pronunciation:This criterion refers to the ability to produce comprehensible speech to fulfil the Speaking test requirements. The key indicators will be the amount of strain caused to the listener, the amount of the speech which is unintelligible and the noticeability of L1 influence.</li>

 					<h3 class="mt-0"> IELTS Preparation Tips - Speaking Section</h3>
                    <p>
               One of the most interesting sections of the IELTS test, the speaking section involves one-on-one live interaction with an invigilator. This test analyses the proficiency pertaining to spoken English and the duration of this section is between 11 and 14 minutes. The speaking test requires one to be spontaneous as it is a human interaction as opposed to a computerized one. The test is divided into three parts.
                   </p>
                   <p> <li>First part:</li> </p>
                   <p> In the first part, the examiner asks some general questions to the test taker about their personal interests, academic background, family, etc. Here are the tips to crack this section:
                   	<li>Adding value to replies: It is good to be specific with the responses but candidates can always add some interesting facts in their reply. Eg: If asked, 'where are you from?' Besides answering the usual they can add some detail about the place you are from as well.</li>
                   	<li>Must be responsive: Candidates must respond promptly. They should be quick and responsive throughout the Speaking section.</li>
                   </p>
                    <p> <li>Second part:</li> </p>
                    <p>	 In this part, test takers are given a topic and asked to speak uninterrupted on the topic for at least two to three minutes. The examiner tests both speaking skills and knowledge of the examinee.
                    	<li>Thinking before Speaking: Though it is important to be responsive, still it is ideal to take at least a minute before one starts speaking. It brings clarity to the points candidates are going to make and most importantly the manner they would begin the speech.</li>
                   	<li>Knowledge: Examinees should ensure that they have knowledge about what they are speaking about. They should be able to communicate the key points of the topic to the invigilator.</li>
                    </p>
                     <p> <li>Third part:</li> </p>
                     <p> This part is important as here the examiner asks questions about the topic from the second part. The examiner can put forward some arguments taken from candidate's speech or he/she might ask to elaborate on a specific point of view the candidate had previously shared.</p>
                     <li>Arguments to be remembered: Arguments from the previous test part should be kept in mind. Test takers should not look surprised or taken off guard when asked a question.</li>
                     <li>No room for confusion: The answers should not reflect confusion. It is important to project confidence and willingness to respond.</li>
                     <p> <li>Some other IELTS Preparation tips for Speaking section</li> </p>

                   	<li>This is the section where one can enjoy speaking English, thus it is vital to sound confident and talk as fluently as possible.</li>
                   	<li>Candidates can practice by recording their responses on tape at home and listen to it. It will be easier to focus on individual mistakes and pronunciation.</li>
                   	<li>It is advisable not to prepare the answers, as the examiner may spot the same.</li>
                   	<li>The best way to respond is to present one's opinion, as that will help them assess his/her English communication skills.</li>
                   	<li>Candidates should remember that there is nothing called a single answer and there is no right or wrong answer. However, test takers should ensure that their ideas and opinions are conveyed in a proper manner.</li>

         	         <p>
         	         	Logical reasoning is the ability to recognize and determine the meaning of patterns using a variety of information. It is the primary tool used in solving problems of every kind, including math problems. Every candidate has these skills and uses them in all aspects of daily life, sometimes even without consciously being aware of it.Logical Reasoning questions are designed to measure an aspirant’s ability to understand a system of relationships and to draw appropriate conclusions about those relationships. Each question is based on a short passage or a set of conditions. These questions focus on Logical consistency as well as numerical reasoning based type questions. Logical reasoning requires drawing conclusions from a set of rules, statements or conditions that describe relationships among entities such as persons, places, or things. Data Interpretation is the section which consists of charts and tables, myriad of graphs, from which candidates will have to analyze and glean data. The key to crack data interpretation is to quickly identify the key pieces of the data given in the question.The data interpretation questions may seem lengthy but the key to solving these questions is to identify the important pieces of data and approach the question in a step by step process. Charts, venn diagrams, myriad graphs, tables, etc. usually dominate the data interpretation section.

         	        The basic concept that operates behind data interpretation questions is to test candidates on their ability to make decisions and establish what would be the best for different situations. Each set of DI question in CAT exam generally consists of multiple conditions and candidates are supposed to use the clues to solve the questions.

         	         </p>
                    <p> <li>Draw the LR Questions on Paper, not on the Mind</li> </p>
                    <p>Logical Reasoning questions are mostly based on arrangement type questions, that will have certain conditions to fulfill. Great attention to detail helps to solve them in a very less time. Experts say to draw the conditions first and then start answering the given questions. </p>
                    <p> <li>Critical Thinking is critical to solve Logical Reasoning Questions</li> </p>
                    <p>Consider this question –There are four males sitting on a bench to be photographed.Ravi,Vijay,Ram,Sonu.They are sitting as per these conditions:1. Vijay is sitting to the left of Ravi 2. Ram is sitting to the right of Ravi.<b>Question: Who would be 2nd to the left, in the photograph?</b>The Answer is Sonu. Read the question again – Who would be the 2nd to the left, IN THE PHOTOGRAPH When the sentence, in the Photograph comes, the seating arrangement will turn to 180 degrees.So, Sonu would be 2nd to the left, in the photograph.Had the question been – who is the person sitting 2nd to the left, for the photographer, then the arrangement would be – Ram, Sonu, Ravi and Vijay.So, it is seen how these little things can affect the answers and ability to score the marks in CAT exam. Time and again, it has been stressed, the questions like this, consists of three to four questions which will be carrying more marks. If one condition is not looked upon critically, the whole arrangement will be wrong, which in turn will affect the marks.</p>
                     <p> <li>Put in Small Blanks to Fill Question Figures There</li> </p>
                     <p>If the number of people is given in the question, then the figure must be drawn first. For example, if the question says, five people, sitting around the circle facing the center- then the sequence with 5 blank spaces should be quickly drawn.Once the conditions of those questions are read, dissecting them bit by bit, will help to solve the Logical Reasoning questions faster. So, putting the pieces together and the right arrangement will be easily made.</p>
                     <h3 class="mt-0">Tips to solve CAT Data Interpretation questions</h3>
         	         </p>
                    <p> <li>Candidates should read the figures given carefully and should not over approximate to simplify their task.</li> </p>
                    
                    <p> <li>Candidates should not assume data or information that is not mentioned in the questions.</li> </p>
        
                     <p> <li>Candidates should improve their speed, as data interpretation questions revolve around arithmetic and calculation speed.</li> </p>
                     <p>The competition is increasing over the years with numerous CAT aspirants applying for the exam every year. So, aspirants are required to be dedicated and well-focused for the exam. With proper preparation, the data interpretation questions can be solved easily and admission into the IIMs or any other prestigious B-School can be easily acquired.</p>
